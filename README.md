# unFold

**unFold** is a Firefox extension for foldable Android devices, designed to automatically switch websites between their mobile and desktop layouts as you fold and unfold your screen.

It intelligently injects a desktop User-Agent when the screen is unfolded to make websites provide a desktop experience, and reverts this when the screen is folded back to ensure the best mobile experience. For websites that don't respond to a simple User-Agent change, it provides powerful URL redirection functionality.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Automatic Mode Switching**: Seamlessly transitions between mobile and desktop site versions based on the screen's folded/unfolded state.
* **User-Agent Injection**: Pretends to be a desktop browser on unfolded screens, tricking websites into serving their desktop layout.
* **Powerful URL Redirection**: Uses customizable regex rules to force specific mobile/desktop URLs for sites that don't respond to User-Agent changes alone.
* **Flexible Modes**:
    * **Auto (Denylist Mode)**: Automatically switches modes for all sites, except those in your denylist.
    * **Auto (Allowlist Mode)**: Switches modes only for sites in your allowlist.
    * **Always Desktop**: Forces the desktop version on all websites, regardless of the screen's state (except for sites in the denylist).
    * **Off**: Disables all functionality.
* **Auto-Refresh**: Automatically reloads the page when the mode changes to instantly display the correct site version.
* **List Management**: Easily add or remove the current website from your denylist or allowlist directly from the popup.

    * If a site is already on a list, the button will change to `Remove from...` allowing you to easily undo the action.
